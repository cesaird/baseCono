Initial Check-in
•
[00:07] César da Silva started the interaction with a brief acknowledgment of the participants' presence. Although this was
a routine check-in, it set the tone for the meeting, ensuring that everyone was prepared to proceed.
Understanding Enterprise Data Architecture and QBI System
•
[36:54] César da Silva initiated the discussion about the QBI system, explaining that it is currently the primary system used
by MN8 to manage data. He mentioned that in the coming weeks, the system would start consuming information from the
data lake, signaling the importance of this integration for MN8’s operations. This introduction by César helped set the stage
for understanding how QBI works and its signiVcance in the overall data management strategy.
•
[37:21] Rafael Pavon responded to a question posed by Rui Dias regarding the internal processes of QBI. Rafael admitted
that there is limited detailed information available about what happens to the data once it is inside QBI. He elaborated that
while the team is aware of the connections and some interfaces being built, the full scope of QBI's internal data handling
remains unclear. This transparency from Rafael highlighted a potential gap in knowledge that could affect the integration
process.
•
[37:32] Rafael Pavon further elaborated on the role of QBI within MN8. He explained that QBI serves as the main information
system for all operations related to solar energy farms. Rafael emphasized that QBI is critical for MN8, as it centralizes data
collected from various Veld stations and integrates this information with YARDI, an administrative system. This integration
ensures that all data related to solar energy farms is consolidated within QBI, making it the authoritative source for reporting
and analysis. Rafael's detailed explanation provided the Innowave team with a clearer understanding of how QBI operates
within MN8’s infrastructure.
•
[38:02] Rafael Pavon also pointed out that while QBI is central to MN8’s solar operations, the company operates other
business lines, such as electric vehicles, which are managed differently. He explained that these different business lines
might have distinct data management processes, but QBI remains the core system for solar energy data. This information
was crucial for the Innowave team to understand the broader context of MN8’s operations and the speciVc role QBI plays in
it. Rafael Pavon shared with InnoWave team the MN8 web portal that allows dynamic navigation of the current MN8 data
architecture. InnoWave team was unaware of this tool until now.
•
[38:45] Rafael Pavon returned to address concerns about how different business units interact with QBI. He acknowledged
that QBI’s behavior could vary depending on the business unit, which complicates the task of integrating and standardizing
data processes. Rafael highlighted that these differences are a natural consequence of MN8's diverse operations, but they
do pose challenges for creating a uniVed data management approach. His input was vital in recognizing the complexity
involved in how multiple business lines are integrated under a single data management system.
Data Flow and System Integration
•
[38:05] Rui Dias asked follow-up questions about the data flow within QBI and its integration with other systems, speciVcally
how data is handled once it enters QBI. This inquiry aimed to uncover any potential issues or gaps in the integration process
that could impact the project’s success.
•
[38:32] Luis Seabra mentioned that the high-level understanding of QBI was helpful but pointed out ongoing questions
about how QBI behaves differently across various business units. He noted that these differences, along with changes in the
system, make it challenging to fully understand QBI’s operations. Luis's observation highlighted the need for a more detailed
analysis to ensure that the integration aligns with the speciVc needs of each business unit.
ClariXcations and Next Steps
•
[39:00] Rui Dias checked with the team to see if there were any further questions or clariVcations needed. Both Andre
Oliveira and Nuno Silva conVrmed that they had no additional questions.
•
[39:12] Luis Almeida then summarized the discussion, thanking Rafael Pavon for the detailed explanations and
contributions. Luis emphasized the importance of reviewing all the provided documentation to ensure a thorough
understanding of QBI and its integration points. He also mentioned that the Innowave team would reach out if further
clariVcation was required.
•
[39:34] Rafael Pavon assured the Innowave team that he would be available for any follow-up discussions and further
clariVed that QBI is expected to handle all necessary reports and data processing for the solar energy farms. His willingness
to support the team underscored MN8's commitment to the project’s success.

4. Discussion and Decisions
Resource Constraints and Project Challenges
.
[37:49] Cesar da Silva expressed his frustration regarding the significant resource challenges impacting the project. He pointed
out that despite MN8 being a large company, they have not allocated sufficient resources to this project. Cesar emphasized that
the existing team is stretched too thin, and this lack of adequate support is causing immense pressure. He mentioned that he
has been involved in the project for about eight months and has observed that the expectations from leadership do not align
with the team's actual capacity. He stated that this misalignment is leading to delays and contributing to the team's stress levels.
[38:01] Cesar further elaborated, stating that while the timeline for the project is aggressive, it is also unrealistic given the current
resource allocation. He emphasized that the perception that the project can be managed efficiently with the existing resources
is incorrect. Cesar urged the group to reconsider the timeline and seek additional support from leadership to ensure the project's
success.
[39:35] Cesar also highlighted a critical issue: despite MN8 being a large organization, the resources available for this project
are extremely limited. He quoted a statement from a senior leader, "You are all what we have," indicating that the current team
must handle all aspects of the project. Cesar expressed concern that this approach is not sustainable and that the project will
continue to face significant hurdles unless more resources are allocated.
Stakeholder Alignment and Communication Issues
. [38:33] Cesar da Silva addressed the complexities surrounding stakeholder management within MN8. He described how the
project is being affected by political issues within the company, where different stakeholders have conflicting priorities. Cesar
specifically mentioned Ramon, a key stakeholder, who is under considerable pressure to deliver results. However, Ramon's
challenges are not solely technical; they are compounded by internal politics, making it difficult for him to align with the project's
goals.
[38:45] Cesar explained that Ramon sees the project team as the solution to his problems, which places additional
responsibility and stress on the team. This dynamic is causing delays and complicating the decision-making process. Cesar
suggested that the root of the problem lies in the political landscape of MN8, where different stakeholders are pulling the project
in different directions. He stressed that without a unified approach, the project will continue to face setbacks.
[39:57] In his opinion, the only way to resolve these issues is through better communication and alignment among all
stakeholders. Cesar proposed a more coordinated approach where all key stakeholders are brought together to agree on a clear
and unified direction. He emphasized that without this alignment, the project would remain vulnerable to internal conflicts and
delays.
Solution Proposal and Next Steps
[38:26] Alessandro Annoscia acknowledged the concerns raised by Cesar and Luis Almeida. He agreed that the project timeline
is aggressive and that it is unrealistic to expect the team to meet these deadlines without additional resources or support.
Alessandro stressed the importance of revising the project timeline to better reflect the current resource availability.
[39:11] Alessandro also supported Cesar's call for improved stakeholder alignment and communication. He noted that the
technical challenges are significant, but the greater challenge lies in managing expectations and ensuring the team is not
overburdened. Alessandro suggested that leadership needs to be more involved in resolving these issues and providing clear,
consistent communication to all stakeholders.
[39:52] Alessandro reiterated the importance of developing a detailed communication plan. This plan would help keep all
stakeholders informed and aligned with the project's goals, ensuring that everyone is on the same page regarding timelines,
challenges, and expectations.
